			I've never attended an ideal school due to my poor math, but I found who I am in a humble status.<br>    This is something I realise after grafuate from college.<br>     Without too many competitors in Soochow University, where destiny leads me to, I can stand out from my classmates and be confident to pursue further knowledge for myself. <br>    Imagining if I attended a high-ranking school, such as National Taiwan University, I might feel frustrated in studying and give up learning many things. <br>    <strong>	That is, I appreciate how destiny was arranged, although I got countless trouble through the time.</strong>
